<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>
You have volunteered to get you and your 6 friends tickets for an
up-comming Curling Nations preliminaries match, this weekend. The total
amount of money you collected for this event is $210.32.
You search the interwebs for tickets and discover the event is nearly
sold out, and worse, there is no listing for the 7 seats you need . . .

</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>

Using your favourite <a href="http://www.haskell.org" alt="Haskell">language</a>,
your task is to use the sample ticket listings below to find all possible seating
options for you and your friends. You must satisify either of these conditions:

</p>


<h3> Condition 1 </h3>

<p> Your seats are adjacent to eachother </p>

<pre><code>

       1) GOOD                        BAD
       ..ooooooo.. Adjacent seats  .oo.ooooo..  Seats are not adjacent
       ...........                 ...........
       ...........                 ...........

</code></pre>

<h3> Condition 2 </h3>

<p>

Your seats two up two adjacent rows and seats are adjacent. See the definition
of <a href="https://www.answers.com/Q/What_are_piggy_back_seats_in_a_football_stadium">Piggy back seats</a>.

</p>

<pre><code>
       2) GOOD                        BAD
       ..ooo...... Adjacent        .oooo......  Seats are directly above and below
       .oooo...... and directly    .oo........
       ........... below           .o.........

       2) GOOD                        BAD
       ...........                 ...........  Seats are not adjacent on the lower
       .oooo......                 .ooooo.....  row.
       ooo........                 .o...o.....

       2) GOOD                        BAD
       ...........                 ...........  Majority of the seats are not
       oooo.......                 ..oooo.....  directly across from eachother.
       o..........                 ooo........

</code></pre>


<p>
It's very important to keep within the groups budget, try to use every
penny if you can. Assume everyone prefers seats closer to the ends.

<h2> Ticket Data </h2>

<p>

Blue sections are the best, but also the most expensive, green are mid
range and yellow are the least expensive.
